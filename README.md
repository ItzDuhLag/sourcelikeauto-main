# sourcelikeauto
This is an open source initiative project to make an autoclicker, with source like aspects, trying to be as user friendly as possible in order to expand my (ItzDuhLag) personal resume.
An open source project which all respects go to the original creator of this project being ItzDuhLag on github.
